What’s stdint.h?
    This header defines a set of integral type aliases with specific width requirements, along with macros specifying their limits and macro functions to create values of these types.
    This is a header file that provides access to several functions related to integer standards, such as uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t . These functions specify the exact width of integers. These functions allow code to be more portable by setting widths dependent on the processor targets (whether 32 bit or 64 bit, for example).

What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    Integer type with a width of exactly 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits.
    These functions are a cross-platform implementation of a standard data type. 
    uint8_t is an unsigned int of 8 bits, 
    uint32_t is an unsigned long long, 
    int32_t is a signed long long, 
    and a uint16_t is an unsigned 16 bit int.
    
How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    typedef uint8_t  BYTE; = 1 Bytes
    typedef uint32_t DWORD; = 4 Bytes
    typedef int32_t  LONG; = 4 Bytes
    typedef uint16_t WORD; = 2 Byste


What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? 
Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
    ASCII = B + M
    Hex = 0x4D42

What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    bfSize = The size, in bytes, of the bitmap file
    biSize = The number of bytes required by the structure. The structure is the struct BITMAPINFOHEADER. That is a fixed value

What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    If biHeight is positive, the bitmap is a bottom-up DIB with the origin at the lower left corner. 
    If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB with the origin at the upper left corner.

What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount
    Specifies the number of bits per pixel (bpp). For uncompressed formats, this value is the average number of bits per pixel. 
    For compressed formats, this value is the implied bit depth of the uncompressed image, after the image has been decoded. 

Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
    fopen will return null if it cannot open the file. This can happen if there is not enough memory or the file cannot be found.

Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    The third argument determines the number of elements fread will read. So this argument is always 1 because we are always reading one file.

What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    1 (4-bi.biWidth (=3))
    
What does fseek do?
    fseek moves the file position indicator.
    
What is SEEK_CUR?
    SEEK_CUR is an option used in fseek to set the offset relative to the current pointer position.
